---Raptor Sound
This engine sound comes with two variations.
The difference between the two is the police radio chatter.
If you would like to use this sound on civilian vehicles, you can use the sound name of "lg100rptorv8"
If you want to use this sound on emergency vehicles and have radio chatter, use the sound name of "lg100rptorv8rad"
This sound was commissioned by me from Legacy_DMC.

---Charger
There are two versions of the charger.
The version included in the stream folder is setup that only stock wheels will work with the standard body. Any other wheel will require the widebody.
The version included in OPTIONS is designed to be used with a script like VStancer. 

If you want to replace with the VStancer version, drag the files from OPTIONS and just replace them in the stream folder.

If you do not want to replace with the VStancer version, make sure to delete the two files!

---Mustang
If you would like to change the red stripe on the car to black, replace the oem_ford_mustangmach1red_1_diff file located in the OPTIONS folder in the YTD for the Mustang.
